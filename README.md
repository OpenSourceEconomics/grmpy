# grmpy

``grmpy``  is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the generalized Roy model. It serves as a teaching tool to promote the conceptual framework of the generalized Roy model, illustrate a variety of issues in the econometrics of policy evaluation, and showcases basic software engineering practices. <br>
Marginal Treatment Effects (MTE) can be estimated based on a parametric normal model or,
alternatively, via the semiparametric method of Local Instrumental Variables (LIV).
