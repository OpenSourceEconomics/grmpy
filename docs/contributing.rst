Contributing
============

Great, you are interested in contributing to the package.

To get acquainted with the code base, you can check out our `issue tracker <https://github.com/grmToolbox/grmpy/issues>`_ for some immediate and clearly defined tasks. For more involved contributions, please see our roadmap below.

Roadmap
-------

We aim for improvements to the ``grmpy`` package in three domains: Objects of Interest, Estimation Methods, and Numerical Methods.

Objects of Interest
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* adding marginal surplus and marginal cost parameters as presented in Eisenhauer et al. (2015 :cite:`Eisenhauer2015`)

Estimation Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* implementing polynomial and local-instrumental variable estimation as outlined Heckman et al. (2006 :cite:`HeUrVy06`)

Numerical Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* exploring alternative optimization algorithms to address large estimation tasks
