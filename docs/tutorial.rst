Tutorial
========

We now illustrate the basic capabilities of the ``grmpy`` package. We start with the assumptions about functional form and the distribution of unobservables and then turn to some simple use cases.

Assumptions
------------

The ``grmpy`` package implements the normal linear-in-parameters version of the generalized Roy model. Both potential outcomes and the cost associated with treatment participations :math:`(Y_1, Y_0, C)` are a linear function of the individual's observables :math:`(X, Z)` and random components :math:`(U_1, U_0, U_C)`.

.. math::
    Y_1 & = X \beta_1 + U_1 \\
    Y_0 & = X \beta_0 + U_0 \\
    C   & = Z \gamma + U_C \\

We collect all unobservables determining treatment choice in :math:`V = U_C - (U_1 - U_0)`. The unobservables follow a normal distribution :math:`(U_1, U_0, V) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)` with mean zero and covariance matrix :math:`\Sigma`.  Individuals decide to select into treatment if their surplus from doing so is positive :math:`S = Y_1 - Y_0 - C`. Depending on their decision, we either observe :math:`Y_1` or :math:`Y_0`.

Model Specification
-------------------

You can specify the details of the model in an initialization file (`example <https://github.com/restudToolbox/package/blob/master/respy/tests/resources/kw_data_one.ini>`_). This file contains several blocks:

**SIMULATION**

The *SIMULATION* block contains some basic information about the simulation request.

=======     ======      ==================
Key         Value       Interpretation
=======     ======      ==================
agents      int         number of individuals
seed        int         seed for the specific simulation
source      str         specified name for the simulation output files
=======     ======      ==================

**TREATED**

The *TREATED* block specifies the number of covariates determining the potential outcome in the treated state and the values for the coefficients :math:`\beta_1`.

=======     ======  ==================
Key         Value   Interpretation
=======     ======  ==================
coeff       float   intercept coefficient
coeff       float   coefficient of the first covariate
coeff       float   coefficient of the second covariate
 ...
=======     ======  ==================

**UNTREATED**

The *UNTREATED* block specifies the number of covariates determining the potential outcome in the untreated state and the values for the coefficients :math:`\beta_0`. Note that the covariates need to be identical to the *TREATED* block.

=======     ======  ==================
Key         Value   Interpretation
=======     ======  ==================
coeff       float   intercept coefficient
coeff       float   coefficient of the first covariate
coeff       float   coefficient of the second covariate
 ...
=======     ======  ==================

**COST**

The *COST* block specifies the number of covariates determining the cost of treatment and the values for the coefficients :math:`\gamma`.

=======     ======  ==================
Key         Value   Interpretation
=======     ======  ==================
coeff       float   intercept coefficient
coeff       float   coefficient of the first covariate
coeff       float   coefficient of the second covariate
 ...
=======     ======  ==================

**DIST**

The *DIST* block specifies the distribution of the unobservables.

======= ======      ==========================
Key     Value       Interpretation
======= ======      ==========================
coeff    float      :math:`\sigma_{U_0}`
coeff    float      :math:`\sigma_{U_1,U_0}`
coeff    float      :math:`\sigma_{U_0,V}`
coeff    float      :math:`\sigma_{U_1}`
coeff    float      :math:`\sigma_{U_1,V}`
coeff    float      :math:`\sigma_{V}`

Examples
--------

In the following chapter we explore the basic features of the ``grmpy`` package. The resources for the tutorial are also available `online <https://github.com/grmToolbox/grmpy/tree/pei_doc/docs/tutorial>`_. So far you can only simulate the sample from the generalized Roy model as specified in the initialization file.

::

    import grmpy

    grmpy.simulate('tutorial.grmpy.ini')


This creates a number of output files that contains information about the resulting simulated sample.

* **data.respy.info**, basic information about the simulated sample
* **data.grmpy.txt**, simulated sample in a simple text file
* **data.grmpy.pkl**, simulated sample as a pandas data frame
