Welcome to grmpy's documentation!
=================================

``grmpy``  is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of the generalized Roy model. It serves as a teaching tool to promote the conceptual framework of the generalized Roy model, illustrate a variety of issues in the econometrics of policy evaluation, and showcase basic software engineering practices.

We build on the following main references:

Vytlacil. `Econometric evaluation of social programs, part i: Causal models, structural models and econometric policy evaluation. <http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1573441207060709/1-s2.0-S1573441207060709-main.pdf?_tid=b933f5c8-6bbe-11e7-8ae8-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1500385435_c69182d36b79b66bbce5f5a7c593617c>`_ In Handbook of Econometrics, volume 6B, chapter 70, pages 4779–4874.
