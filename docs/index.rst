Welcome to grmpy's documentation!
=================================

``grmpy`` is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of generalized Roy Model (Heckman & Vytlacil, 2005 :cite:`HecVyr05`). It's main purpose is to serve as a teaching tool to promote the conceptual framework provided by the generalized Roy model which allows to illustrate a variety of issues in the econometrics of policy evaluation.

We build on the following main references:

Vytlacil. `Chapter 70 Econometric Evaluation of Social Programs, Part I: Causal Models, Structural Models and Econometric Policy Evaluation. <http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1573441207060709/1-s2.0-S1573441207060709-main.pdf?_tid=b933f5c8-6bbe-11e7-8ae8-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1500385435_c69182d36b79b66bbce5f5a7c593617c>`_ Handbook of Econometrics, 6, 4779 – 4874, 2007.
