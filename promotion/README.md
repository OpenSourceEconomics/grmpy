# Promotion

As mentioned before ``grmpy`` is thought of as a teaching tool for promoting the conceptual framework of the generalized Roy model, illustrating a variety of issues in the econometrics of policy evaluation, and for providing a showcase for basic software engineering practices. Therefore this directory contains the lecture material which is used for an introduction of the package and its features in the course on human capital analysis at the University of Bonn. In addition the [affiliated notebook](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/grmpy/blob/develop/promotion/04_grmpy_tutorial_notebook/04_grmpy_tutorial_notebook.ipynb) provides an overview on the ``grmpy``'s basic features as well as some setups that demonstrate the reliability of the package's estimation process.  

For more information about the affiliated course material see [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/econometrics/blob/master/README.md)
